Simple Analogy

Think of Task like a cookie cutter 🍪:

__init__ → bakes a cookie (task) with title, date, etc.

mark_complete() → bites a piece off the cookie (changes the state).

to_dict() → flattens cookie into a recipe card (dictionary).

from_dict() → takes a recipe card and bakes a new cookie.

from_dict doesn’t care about any already-baked cookies → it just knows how to create a fresh one. That’s why it’s @staticmethod.

# t1.mark_complete() is equivalent internally to: Task.mark_complete(t1)
